# SQL Syntax Notebook

## Project Overview
This Jupyter notebook, titled "SQLSyntax.ipynb," serves as a practical guide and reference for various SQL syntaxes and functions. It's designed to help users understand and apply different SQL operations effectively within their projects.

## Key Features
- **SQL Functions and Syntax**: Demonstrates the use of SQL functions, particularly window functions, to analyze data trends and relationships.
- **Practical Examples**: Includes examples to show how different SQL queries can be used to extract and analyze data.
- **Interactive Learning**: Allows users to execute SQL commands within the notebook and see immediate results, facilitating a hands-on learning experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive coding environment that combines live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Used for executing SQL commands through Python.
- **Pandas**: For handling and displaying data within the notebook.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need Python installed on your system, along with Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, ensure you have Pandas and SQLAlchemy installed. You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook pandas sqlalchemy
```

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SQLSyntax-Notebook.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd SQLSyntax-Notebook
```

Launch the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook SQLSyntax.ipynb
```

## Usage
Open the "SQLSyntax.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook to view the documentation and examples. You can modify the SQL queries to experiment with different functions and see how they affect the output data.
